# Little Program to Explore Tailwind CSS Configurations
Playground to better understand how Tailwind should be configured as per docs. As most people will generally start with CRA, Tailwind comes out of the box configured to work with typical CRA configurations (also the TS template). When trying to add this later to a non CRA project, things become a little bit harder to update as you have to edit the webpack configurations. I'm dealing with a desire to upgrade to a newer Tailwind CSS version but am having troubles configuring it in a work environment.
